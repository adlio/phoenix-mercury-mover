# phoenix-mercury-mover

My [Phoenix](https://github.com/kasper/phoenix/) config.

I upgraded to macOS Sierra and [MercuryMover](http://www.heliumfoot.com/mercurymover/) stopped working. So I implemented some of its functionalities with Phoenix.

## Presentation

Move and resize windows on your Mac from the keyboard, positioning them precisely where you want.

## Usage

Once you hit one of the main shortcut keys, a popup shows up that explains which keys to press and what they do.

There are two main shortcut keys:

1. hit `shift-ctrl-alt-up` to move the frontmost window

2. hit `shift-ctrl-alt-right` to resize the frontmost window from right/down

Once a popup is shown, you can hit some keys to move the frontmost window to a preset position and/or size:

- `m` to maximise the window
- `=` to center the window
- `h` to move and resize the window to the left half of the screen
- `esc` to dismiss the popup

I also included 3 personal custom shortcuts which are heavily dependent on my current screen resolutions and sizes:

- `s` => `x: 5, y: 27, width: 1204, height: 756`
- `f` => `x: 5, y: 27, width: 1615, height: 1069`
- `t` => `x: 5, y: 27`
